    "Title": "Carcinogenic potential of metabolites and small molecules",
    "Description": "Carcinogenicity is a result of several potential effects on  cells. This model predicts the carcinogenic potential of a small molecule based on their potential to induce cellular proliferation, genomic instability, oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic responses and epigenetic alterations. Metabokiller uses the Chemical Checker signaturizer to featurize the molecules, and the Lime package to provide interpretable results. Using Metabokiller, the authors screened a panel of human metabolites and experimentally demonstrated two of the predicted carcinogenic metabolites induced carcinogenic transformations in yeast and human cells.\n",
